# Previous assignments and projects
This repository gives some examples of previous assignments and projects, for which I mostly used R, but also Python.
Currently, I am studying "Data Analytics and Business Economics" at Lund University School of Economics and Management, thus, most of the code examples are from courses within the programme.
At the moment, you can find the following in this repository:

1. Submissions for Machine Learning (DABN13)
2. Coming soon: Submissions for Advanced Machine Learning (DABN14)
3. Final Project of Data Visualization (DABN19)
4. Submission for the final exam for a Python course offered by LINC-STEM
